			<h2>Michigan Laws</h2>
				<p>When traveling to Michigan, whether on vacation or for permenant residency, it is imperative to understand the state laws that differ from the rest of the country. Here are a few important regulations to be aware of when in Michigan:</p>
				
				<section>
				
					<h3>Michigan Lefts</h3>
					<p>When planning to move from Highway A to Highway B, it is illegal to turn left at the intersection. In order to transfer from highway to highway, one must turn left into the median cross over, wait for traffic to clear, and either travel straight or make a right turn onto Highway B. This is known as a <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdot/travel/safety/road-users/michigan-lefts" target="_blank" class="external-link">Michigan Left.</a></p>

					<p>As of 2023, the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/msp/divisions/ohsp/safety-programs/distracted-driving" target="_blank" class="external-link">Hands Free law</a> explains that it is illegal to use a cellphone or any mobile device while driving on Michigan roads.
